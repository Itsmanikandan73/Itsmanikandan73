### I just build things that break things | void *whoami(void *arg)

I am just self-taught security reseacher focused on **Reverse Engineering** and **Low-level Programming**.

Currently, I am deep-diving into **x86 Assembly** to understand memory layout and architecture. I build **custom security tools** and **educational exploits** to master these concepts.
