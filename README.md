# Hi, I'm solo_shell 👋

Self-taught and always learning.
I spend my time on **reverse engineering**, **binary exploitation**, **cryptography** and **low-level programming** -mostly because I find fascinating how system work under the hood.

Right now, I'm deep into **x86 assembly** to better understand memory layouts, calling conventions, and how exploits actually happen at the machine level. I write small custom tools and educational Pocs to help me learn (most of my code stays private, since it's often sensitive or half-baked experiments).

### What I'm practicing
Daily challenges and wargames on:

- CryptoHack
- pwn.college
- PicoCTF
- OverTheWire
- Tryhackme

### Community
I started a small Discord server for anyone interested in low-lowel stuff-assembly, RE, pwn, cypto, tooling, whatever. No experts required, just curiosity.

If you're working on similar things or want to chat about a challenge you're stuck on, feel free to reach out. Always happy to discuss or share notes (even if they're messy).

Still figuring it all out, one crash at a time.
