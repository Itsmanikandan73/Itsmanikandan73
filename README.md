# 👋 Hi, I’m solo_shell

Low‑level systems programmer & security learner.

I focus on **building and breaking software** — from writing C tools and shells to reversing binaries and exploiting vulnerabilities.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Into

* **Systems Programming:** C, POSIX, Linux internals
* **Low‑Level Debugging:** GDB, x86 Assembly (NASM)
* **Security / Exploitation:** Pwn, Reverse Engineering, basic exploit dev
* **Crypto (foundations):** Learning the math behind cryptography
* **Automation:** Python & Bash to glue everything together

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Languages:** C, x86 Assembly, Python, Bash
* **Tools:** GDB, objdump, strace, ltrace
* **Platforms:** Linux

---

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🐚 Mini Bash Shell (C)

A simple bash‑like shell written in C to understand:

* process creation (`fork`, `execve`)
* file descriptors & redirection
* basic job control

> Focus: OS concepts, syscalls, process model

---

### ⏰ Digital Clock (C)

Terminal‑based digital clock implemented in C.

> Focus: time handling, terminal control, clean C structure

---

### 🔐 Caesar Decoder (Python)

A simple Caesar cipher decoder written in Python.

> Focus: basic cryptography & scripting

---

## 🧪 Learning & Practice

* 🧩 **CTFs:** pwn.college, CryptoHack, Microcorruption
* 📘 **Daily practice:** C programming, x86 assembly, mathematics
* 📐 **Math:** geometry, number theory fundamentals

---

## 🗓 Weekly Routine (High‑level)

* **Mon–Tue:** Build systems (C / sockets)
* **Wed:** Break systems (GDB / exploits)
* **Thu:** Cryptography + math
* **Fri:** Scripting & automation
* **Sat:** CTFs (Pwn / Rev)
* **Sun:** Pure math & rest

---

## 🚧 Currently Working On

* Improving exploit debugging skills
* Deeper Linux internals (memory, syscalls)
* Writing cleaner, documented C projects
