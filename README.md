### I just build things that break things | [curiosity kills the cat]

I am just self-taught [I'm not gonna call myself anything] focused on **Reverse Engineering** , **Binary Exploitation** , **Cryptography** and **Low-level Programming**.

Currently, I am deep-diving into **x86 Assembly** to understand memory layout and architecture. I build **custom security tools** and **educational exploits** to master these concepts. Actually i just store my codes privately!!
